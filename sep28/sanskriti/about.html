    <p>There is tick tack toe on the whiteboard. The wall is diffrent colors. I have permission to bring a flamethrower. I will automatically assume that this means I can bring weapons. If anyone had complaints ask the guy with the beard, he let me. There may or may not be blood. This is entertaining. I have nothing else to write about. I wish I did, because this is a very small paragraph. There is pizza, my school just had a bomb threat and gun threat in the first 2 months. This paragraph is choppy. Some people need to go skydiving without the paracute. That would be funny. <br>End of paragraph. </p>
